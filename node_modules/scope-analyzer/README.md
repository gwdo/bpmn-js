# scope-analyzer

simple scope analysis for javascript ASTs. tracks scopes and collects references to variables.

Caveats and/or todos:

 - This code is extracted from [browser-pack-flat](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/browser-pack-flat)â€”currently browser-pack-flat's test suite are the only tests for this module.
 - May be missing edge cases. Things like `label:`s are not considered at all, but ideally in the future they will!

## Install

```
npm install scope-analyzer
```

## Usage

Note: AST nodes passed to `scope-analyzer` functions are expected to reference the parent node on a `node.parent` property.
Nodes from [falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel) or [transform-ast](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/transform-ast) have a `.parent` property, but others may not, so make sure you've got that set up somehow.

```js
var scan = require('scope-analyzer')

var ast = parse('...')
// Initialize node module variables
scan.createScope(ast, ['module', 'exports', '__dirname', '__filename'])
scan.analyze(ast)

var binding = scan.getBinding(ast, 'exports')
binding.getReferences().forEach(function (reference) {
  // Assume for the sake of the example that all references to `exports` are assignments like
  // `exports.xyz = abc`
  console.log('found export:', reference.parent.property.name)
})
```

## API

### `analyze(ast)`

Walk the ast and analyze all scopes. This will immediately allow you to use the `get*` methods on any node in the tree.

### `visitScope(node)`

Visit a node to check if it initialises any scopes.
For example, a function declaration will initialise a new scope to hold bindings for its parameters.
Use this if you are already walking the AST manually, and if you don't need the scope information during this walk.

### `visitBinding(node)`

Visit a node to check if it is a reference to an existing binding.
If it is, the reference is added to the parent scope.
Use this if you are already walking the AST manually.

### `createScope(node, bindings)`

Initialise a new scope at the given node. `bindings` is an array of variable names.
This can be useful to make the scope analyzer aware of preexisting global variables.
In that case, call `createScope` on the root node with the names of globals:

```js
var ast = parse('xyz')
scopeAnalyzer.createScope(ast, ['HTMLElement', 'Notification', ...])
```

### `scope(node)`

Get the [Scope](#scope) initialised by the given node.

### `getBinding(node, name)`

Get the [Binding](#binding) named `name` that is available to `node`.
The binding must be declared in the current scope or a scope initialised by any parent node.

### Scope

#### `scope.has(name)`

Check if this scope defines `name`.

#### `scope.getBinding(name)`

Get the [Binding](#binding) named `name` that is declared by this scope.

#### `scope.getReferences(name)`

Get a list of all nodes referencing the `name` binding that is declared by this scope.

#### `scope.forEach(cb(binding, name))`

Loop over all bindings declared by this scope.

### Binding

#### `binding.definition`

The node that defined this binding.

#### `binding.getReferences()`

Return an array of nodes that reference this binding.
